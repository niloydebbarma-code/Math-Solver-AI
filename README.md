### Math Solver AI by Niloy Deb Barma

## Overview
I've developed the Math Solver AI to automate the solution of various mathematical problems using advanced algorithms and machine learning models. It aims to provide accurate solutions to equations and calculus problems, making mathematics more accessible and understandable.

## Features
1. Equation Solving: I can solve equations of different types including linear, quadratic, and systems of equations.
2. Calculus Problems**: I can perform differentiation and integration of functions.
3. Graph-Plotting: I can generate plots to visualize mathematical functions.
4. Step-by-Step Solutions: I provide detailed step-by-step solutions for educational purposes.

## Installation
To install Math Solver AI, follow these steps:

1. Clone my repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-solver-ai.git
   $ cd math-solver-ai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
You can use it in your Python projects as follows:

```python
from math_solver_ai import solver

# Example: Solve a linear equation
equation = "2x + 5 = 15"
solution = solver.solve_equation(equation)
print(solution)

# Example: Differentiate a function
function = "x^2 + 2x + 1"
derivative = solver.differentiate(function)
print(derivative)

# Example: Integrate a function
integral = solver.integrate(function)
print(integral)

# Example: Plot a graph
function = "x^2 - 4"
solver.plot_graph(function)
```

## Supported Problems
It currently support:
1. Linear equations
2. Quadratic equations
3. Systems of equations
4. Differentiation and integration of algebraic functions
5. Plotting 2D graphs
